title: Batch normalization in TensorFlow
subtitle: (now with less pain!)

<!-- Summary:  These are just personal notes on implementing batch normalization in tensor flow so you don't need to read that paper to remember what all these parameters are, and don't fall for any common gotchas.
-->

# Batch normalization overview

# Implementation for a single hidden layer

## Gotcha: Forgetting that mean/variance are only computed at training.

# Implementation for a multilayer network

# Implementation for a multilayer convolutional neural network
