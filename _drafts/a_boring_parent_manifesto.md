Consider the following items:

  * Over the course of the last three years my wife and I have spent a minimum of 120 hours reading a book that is 20 pages long and contains no conflict or plot, just construction equipment [1].

  * I had a delightful "meal" with my son this morning made out of play-dough. Every interaction consisted of me saying "yum" and spooning air into my mouth (he claimed that it was watermelon ice-cream).

  * The amount my wife and I talk about poop is probably alienating our friends who don't have children.

  * All our new friends have children.  We talk about poop.

  * I play tag against a person with legs that are the length of a can of coke.

  * Counting impresses me now. (I have a phd in applied math)

  * My wife and I have spent more than 1000 hours petting a head.

Raising kids takes most of our time outside of work and a good portion of it is kind of boring.  Tag is fun, and the play-dough meal was pleasant, but after 10 minutes my interest wained.

If you're a thinking person, this can be difficult to endure.
You've spent decades having reasoned discussion, often with yourself, and now you must spend a large number of hours having un-reasoned non-discussions with somebody else.

This has a toll.  I often find it difficult to talk about anything besides my work and my child.  My wife and I can't talk about the recent movie releases, we've not seen any.  I suspect many people find me **boring to talk to**.

Perhaps I'm not boring (yet).  If I am, nobody will say it to my face.  However, there is little doubt in my mind that this transformation is in progress each day.  Those witty references to a portions of 80s pop culture, haven't made one of those in over a year.  Fast paced but reasoned discussion on the viability of the welfare state? Hard (but not impossible) to ponder when your face is being used as a pillow.

The time commitment required to do parenting well has side effects, but they are worth it.  Being a boring parent is nothing to be ashamed.  It is merely the payment required to raise a kid well, and the ROI is clear once he/she lovingly asks to sleep on your belly at night.

I suspect it's a typical teenage experience to look at your parents (like I once did) and wonder "why are they lacking in charm and wit?"  We'll look in the mirror pimple-beak.  You sucked the wit and charm out of them.  Wit is a muscle that can only be strengthened in an environment free of distractions.  Cultivating that environment for somebody else other than yourself means that you don't get to exercise.  The gym only has one treadmill, and reverse-seniority is the rule.  Enjoy your workout sport.

For me, realizations like the above paragraph are one of the bonus perks to having a kid.  You acquire a new appreciation for your own parents, and, more broadly, a new perspective on the machinations of humanity which sometimes feels like you took the red pill without knowing it.

Anyway, I'm writing this post for selfish reasons (it's fun), but also because a friend of mine, a fellow brain, recently had a kid.  Then I started to Facebook stalk and realized a lot of people I know have become parents in the past year.

It's no secret that raising a kid is hard, but for thoughtful people there is an extra hurdle. It saddens me to witness parts of my mind, parts which I value, descend into darkness as the synapsis separate and slowly but surely fall silent.

My advice to my thinking friends with kids "Don't fight it. Let it go."  The value of another witty 80s reference pails in comparison to the value of reading a cardboard book about dogs to your kid.  By the end of our transformation we will be a completely different people.  Perhaps a "boring" people.  But richer.  See you on the other side.

[1] [road work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8036454-roadwork) takes about 20 minutes to read to our son.  We read it every night for a year.  That's 10 hours per month for 12 months.
