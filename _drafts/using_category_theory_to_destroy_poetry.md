TLDR:
  Analogies are to poets what functors are to mathematicians

Example:

Example: Flirting by rolling a ball

Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better but the frog dies in the process (EB White)

Life is like a box of chocolates – you never know what you’re gonna get (Forrest Gump)


This article makes the case for why analogies are important.
This functor from poetry/literature allows us to make the case that category theory is useful for learning new things.  So I can basically say ditto.
