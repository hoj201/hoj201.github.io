**Spoiler Alert!!!** *The narration of Raising Arizona is beautiful, and quoted often throughout this post.  Please watch this film before reading!  You will not regret it.*

Raising Arizona, 1985, the 2nd film by the Coen Brothers.
I loved this movie at age 12, and I still love it at age 32.
However, viewing this movie 20 years later is a much different experience.
Perhaps closer to the one originally intended by the creators (if there is such an experience).

## Nutshell Summary
High McDonagh is a recidivist felon who's life consist of the following code snippet
```python
while Alive:
  high.rob_liquor_store()
  high.go_to_prison()
  high.get_parol()
  if met_edwina:
    break
```
Edwina is a police officer who snaps High's picture every time he gets locked up.
They meet, fall in love:

Naturally, they desire to have a child.  However, Edwina is barren, and they enter a depression.  Until one fine day they hear of the Arizona quintets.  Five children born to a wealthy business man, Nathan Arizona.

>  ... answer to all our prayers.

Then the most awesome title screen in film history happens.  Then Act II happens.  Then Act III happens.  I'll talk about those later.

## Who is this villian?
High McDonagh is the enemy
This is a movie about transcending one's self.
The villian, Barges, is a monster born from High's mind

> quote about the first appearence of the villian

(or is he?).
Hi turns to Ed and says "You see him too"?  Of course she sees him.
Barges is a manifestation of the High's selfish nature.
The part of high that robs liquor stores, gets drunk with the boys, and leaves
his wife picking up the pieces.
So of course Ed sees this part of High.

But who or what is he?  The answer becomes clear when High reveals the tatoo on his arm.  Woody wood-pecker.

## What does a family do to an individual?
[Picutre of villian exploding]
A good marriage involves the (creative?) destruction of personality.
Literally embodied by an explosion in this movie.
Twelve years ago I desired to be the greatest director of all time, purely for the glory of myself.
Ten years ago I was in the early stages of marriage and a career in mathematics,
as I witnessed that younger part of me being destroyed, and it was painful.
Twenty years later my marriage has matured, I have a child, yet
I can still recognize that film-maker in me.
However, the film-maker is but a vaguely familiar stranger, as opposed to an integral part of my personality.
This is undoubtedly a better mental place.
But I don't feel complete.

I think the film takes some stance on this.
We aren't designed to be complete, but who cares.

> quote related to the sunset

Typically, the Coen brothers are characterized by how they raise questions without answering them.
I'd say in most films this is true (most Notable "A Serious Man").
This makes "Raising Arizona" stand out.
It is the least nihilistic and most optimistic of any of their films I think,
and the most assertive in stating that life is worth living.

## The end

> Maybe it was somewhere else.  Maybe it was Utah.

Then high's eyes open.
