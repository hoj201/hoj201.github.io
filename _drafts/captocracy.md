Francis Fukiyama said capitalism and democracy are a marriage made in heaven. Both are systems that require and feed off freedom of individuals.  However, there is a crucial distinction in the way "voting" occurs in both systems.  In a democracy voting occurs by... uh votes.  In a capitalist economy, voting occurs at the cash register.  So by construction, rich people will have more voting power with regards to the constitution of the economy.
