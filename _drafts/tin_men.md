Tin Men (1987)

Baltimore, 1963, we see BB (Richard Dreyfuss) sit down to negotiate the purchase of a new Cadillac.

> BB: Now don't try to hustle me here ... you know what I mean. I hate being hustled. Give me an honest price, not one of your *special deals*... give me an honest price. Do I make myself clear?

> SALESMAN:Now, how much are you willing to pay?

> BB: There ya go... there ya go... you're doing it... you're doing one of those hustle numbers.

> SALESMAN: I'm just trying to get an idea how much you're willing to pay.

> BB: Four dollars... I want to pay four dollars a month.

> SALESMAN: That's not an honest answer.

> BB: What do ya want to hear? That I'd love to pay three hundred and fifty a month... is that what you want to hear? Tell me how much you want me to pay and I'll tell you how much I'll pay, but don't do a hustle on me... I don't like that. How much do I want to pay? I'd like to pay nothing!

BB wants a Cadillac.  Does he need a Cadillac?  Certainly, not. How does he pay for this Cadillac? Answer: He sells aluminum siding to people who do not need it. This is how the economy churns productivity, but this movie makes it feel more like a shell game.

Of course, the old-school economists will say that these swaps are good because at the end of the day some guy who wants aluminum siding has it, and BB has his Cadillac (which he wants more than aluminum siding). However, the flaw is in the notion of "want". This clip demonstrates how BB sells aluminum siding

 The customers that BB convinces to purchase aluminum siding often do not even know what aluminum siding is before he shows up. BB creates desires where there were none before. Similarly, the Cadillac is viewed as necessary to own for a good salesman, and they are displayed prominently throughout the movie. When Tilley's wife suggest getting a cheaper car he replies

 > It doesn't instill confidence in my clients. Cadillac means that you're dealing with someone of importance. -Tilley

 Again, it's not as if these desires come from within. They are planted from the outside.  Which makes you wonder, wouldn't it be easier to just not plant all these desires and just let people be? These salesman produce the churn in the economy, but to what end?

The movie depicts a world of salesman, who survive off hustling others into a sale through various deceptive practices, however, they are portrayed (I think accurately) as good guys. Everybody is trying to hustle, or is working at a company that produces something, and that something is sold by salesman, and their job is to hustle.

Despite my tendency to portray every little thing as "deep", Tin Men as a very light movie. In fact, as I'm writing this I'm realizing this essay is probably written as a personal back-lash to having watched 2001:A Space Oddessey three times in the last few months. If there is a message to Tin Men, it's "Life is a difficult hustle, but it's also fun."

Most of the scenes occur over meals in Diners, drinks in bars, and leisure time at pool halls and race tracks. Even during work scenes, the story only moves along during the social breaks where the salesman play poker or grab a snow-cone. Such is life. The narrative of our own life does not evolve during work. It evolves in our time off.  Which it's why it's so unfortunate that the work hours are growing, because this means leisure time must necessarily be shrinking, and thus our lives just have less content in them.

It's too easy to watch this movie in the era of #MeToo and #BLM and proceed critique its nostalgia for the 1960s. Literally every character (except Tilley's wife) is a white male having a good time.

Currently I'm in the middle of the second novel in Elena Ferrante's Neopolitan series (The Story of a New Name).  Like tin men, the story focuses on the inner life of the gender of the writer (in this case female). The men in the novel are three dimensional, but the description of the men is done in terms of events and actions while that of the protagonist and her frenemy are expressed in terms of inner-life events. Also like Tin Men, the secondary gender is still portrayed somewhat realistically.


In all likelyhood, BB and Nora get married, then have a rocky marriage because BB is inherently a deceitful person, and these colors will show once the honey-moon and puppy love ends.

[in bonanza nobody gets laid](https://youtu.be/psoaCxQ6u5w) this clip is so meta in that the fuel of the movie is these conversations about trivialities. The movie itself is like a critique of 60s TV (notably this movie predates Resevoir dogs by a few years)

Watching Planet Earth with my son, we saw large flocks of birds (the plaines, the most numerous birds).  You wonder, clearly the birds can not be fully aware of how to move the flock.  The large scale motion is merely emergent from the small scale dynamics between neighboring birds. (Snow geese). As far as these birds can grasp, they are the masters of their destiny, and acting according to their internally driven desires.  However, they are wrong.  Perhaps the aliens on Europa viewing us from their telescopes have the same thoughts when they see the economic machinations we've made:
 - Forex
 - Drone wars
 - Pokemon Go

Wow, it's amazing how these mindless humans, running on brute hunger and horniness have managed such amazing (seemingly pointless) feats.
