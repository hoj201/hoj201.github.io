James Earl Jones as Mufasa [oozing intelligence that overcame racial adversity in the second half of the 20th century].

Long rant about everytihing being a delicate balance...

Elephant graveyard... Don't go there.  It's basically the ghetto, and a totally lost cause.

whoopi goldberg, CHeech Marin as the Hyeenas

Jeremy Irons is the best villain since
 - Stick with me and you'll never go hungry again! ... Then there is a nazi army of Hyennas
 - decades of denial is simply why I'll, be ....


 dawning of a new era in which Lion an Hyena comes together in a great an glorious future.


 ... Akoonah Matatah, it's a problem free philosophy... basically hangs out with a bunch of hipster pot-heads for a decade
 [they eat roaches].  Best transition in all of animation, when baby Simba slides into adulthood and says "It means no worries, for the rest of your days"


 - Scare is picking his teeth singing about coconuts when the Hyenas come in to say "We have a bone to pick with you." because there is no food.


 - Mandril catches some dust, smells it, knows Simba is alive.


.... temporal lobe acid trip Mufasa shames Mufasa about the whole pot-smoking thing "You have become less than who you are."


Mandril hits him on the head, he gets his sense knocked back into him.... goes back... fights scare... scare gets killed by the hyenas who elected him... Simba is the king... everything is awesome.


Ends with last chorus of circle of life.
