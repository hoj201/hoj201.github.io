Just had a drinking session with Max Walker.  It started professionally regarding criticisms of the company, gripes about Haytham/Aditya.  Then moved to politics. I got back to the bathroom and he asked simply "What do you think of me.  Am I good at my job, any criticism?".  I told him "The first question is easy.  You are very good at your job.  As for criticism... Nerf-herder should have been a full on project.  Not a fly-by-night project." I probably should have not understated that I actually think Max is amazing at his job.  This is doubly embarrassing, because he poured his heart out at me after that.  He said it was sad to see somebody go, who he could talk about "Three Billboards" with, that clearly was talented and good for the company in terms of atmosphere and material contributions.  He had plenty of critical words for other people, and so it felt very genuine.

I felt different coming home.  I just assumed that nobody really saw unusual value in me at Kinetic (overall, I got the impression from Haytham that he thought I was lucky to be working there at all). I hope there is a way to stay in touch with Max.  Perhaps more drinking sessions.
