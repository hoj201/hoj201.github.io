Teens seem to get all the fun when it comes to new books about a dystopian future society which mirrors our own.  The most notable example is "The hunger games", about a society where children compete against their peers to the death for the entertainment and benefit of a small elite of old white people.  This is clearly a reference to student testing... or something.  It's hard to put you're finger on why these books were so successful, but I think it's because kids intuitively know that the world is strange and getting stranger.  The hunger games series gives children some acknowledgement: yeah, our system is cruel and probably amoral.

While kids can turn to the "Hunger games" to get there fix, there are few adult alternatives. Malcolm Harris provides at least one in "Kids These Days".
Like "The Hunger Games", the book is about a society where children compete against their peers to the death for the benefit of a small elite of old while people.
However, this book is in the non-fiction section.

## Non-fiction
A quick an dirty summary:
The baby-boomers started having kids in the 80s during the end-game of the cold war.
They raised them during the age of irrational exuberance on a diet of gold-star stickers and fruit snacks.
During this time we saw a rise in helicopter parenting, detention, suspensions, market-based solutions to government services, college tuition, etc.
All these trends can be seen through the lens of commodification of children.
Malcolm Harris paints a very coherent pictures, and his writing is wickedly beautiful in it's depiction of the dark under-belly of modern education

> passage from "Kids These days"

With the exception of economists, most people do not view children as financial certificates.
However, after competing for a place at NYU, then Caltech, then the academic job market, then finally "selling out" and becoming a data-scientist: I certainly view myself as a commodity.
Have I been brain-washed?
While the book has a lot of flaws, the main point resonated with me.
I act like a commodity because I've been trained to do nothing but compete by offering a return on investment.

## Junk bonds
What happens when some of the child-bonds default?
By default, that means failing math class or going crazy.
You need to cut your losses, and get them off your balance sheet.
When those bonds are people, this means suspension for children and incarceration for adults.
At least this is what Harris suggests.
> quote

Harris suggests that schools are incentivized by numerous things such as standardized testing.
What I find funny about this argument is that mass incarceration is very expensive (oh yeah... also immoral).
It almost appears that the issue is one of pricing.

## Appropriate pricing
What is the appropriate price of a good?
If you're able to run tests you can find it empirically.
You just raise the price until people stop buying.
There is a threshold somewhere, and this threshold is characterized by being the lowest price where people get no benefit from purchasing the good.
It seems that college tuition has surpassed this threshold, at least in the view of Moodys.

So perhaps the tuition should be a tad below this optimal?
Event still, it seems weird to price college such that it barely benefits us.
This is not the picture of higher-education which we've been sold.

## The end
I'll try to avoid spoiling the book.  Let me just say, the last chapter is tough to swallow, and the last subsection is very ambiguous.  One of the reasons I wrote this post was to convince friends to read the book and possibly start a conversation regarding the last paragraph.  In particular: **What does it mean**?
