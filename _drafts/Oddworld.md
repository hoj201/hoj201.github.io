I miss my mommy and daddy. I want to go home. I have lived out of the house for over two decades now, but I miss it.  I miss watching Batman: The Animated Series on a 10 by 10 inch cathode ray, eating ritz crackers, sitting cross legged or on my belly on our beige Nylon carpet. I miss midtown video on middle-field road.  I miss VHS.

The discovery of great film was a big part of my upbringing, and for better or worse, my intellect during my teen years should rightfully be credited to Midtown video in Palo Alto, California (sadly, they closed shop in 2004). The movie that kicked off the never ending binge was Terry Gilliam's sci-fi thriller, 12 Monkeys, where I learned one could get away with style over substance as long as both were present. However, the first truly challenging film I enjoyed was Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Oddesey".

After watching it once, I watched it again a week later.  Then again.  But always by myself. Convincing anybody to watch this movie was and is always a struggle. I tried to convince my brother (he might have been 14 years old at the time) to watch it.  At 15 minutes in, not a single line of dialog had been spoken, the only characters were a bunch of loud apes in the savannah, and my brother was pretty sure we had the wrong cassette in our VCR. At 20 minutes the apes were howling at a black rectangle (referred to as "the monolith") and avant-garde opera music blasted on the soundtrack.  I was surprised to hear no complaint from my brother at this point.  But he couldn't complain.  He had walked out of the room 5 minutes ago.

I love 2001, but I can't blame people for hating it, just as I am sure opera is great for some people, but I don't feel obligated to enjoy it myself. It's quite clear that Kubrick wanted 2001 to be some sort of space opera. The Blue Danube, Ligetti, there is even an intermission. The first shot, after 2 minutes of dissonent flute noises in the dark, is a shot above the moon with the earth and sun aligned in the distance to the sound of Strauss's Thus Spake Zarathustra. Everything about the movie carries weight. But, where does this weight come from? While the film may feel grand and intimidating, interpreting 2001 is actually quite easy to do. The film aggressively refuses to claim any one interpretation as "correct", and in so doing, opens the door to virtually anything an active viewer wishes to bring to the table. This is where the weight comes from.  The film is a religious film, a story about our position relative to god (not unlike the bible, which is also criticized for its pacing). Full of stories, which may be truly meaningless, and of a time long forgotten, but that lives on because the stories feel as if they have meaning, and if they feel like they have meaning we feel compelled to find meaning.  In our search to find meaning we will ultimately come up with something, and snap. From water to wine, we obtain meaning.

In our godless era I feel safe in coming out as a devout atheist.  I don't know for a fact there is no God, but you gotta have faith. I believe the only forces in the universe are:
  - the electro-magnetic force
  - the strong nuclear force
  - the weak nuclear force
  - and gravity (debatably so)
As a result, there is no such thing as free will, we are slaves to the whims of either Lagrangian determinism or Boltzmann statistics, or some mixture of both. Emerging from the heat-bath of evolution, it is merely to the benefit of survival of the species that we believe in free will (fallaciously). We may act as if we have free will, going about our day as creatures with intent.  Most of my thoughts are not briming with intent though. I'm thinking about how I can make dinner using what's in my fridge (beets/mayonaise/left-over rice from Chinese take-out). During these mundane moments, the subconscious is running cron jobs, keeping alive a semi-awareness of the fact that something else is pulling the strings, and this feeling beneath the surface is what compels us to believe in a higher entity, a god.  Of course I act as if I have free will.  I don't have a choice (literally, no choice).

It is in this sense that the HAL 9000 supercomputer emerges as the most human and emotional creature in the entire movie. HAL plays games, and asserts his own consciousness and sense of pride

> We are fool proof and incapable of error. I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all any conscious entity can ever hope to do. -The HAL 9000 computer

In HAL, man has created a god. Or so we think.
When HAL makes an error diagnosing a failed module on the ship, the crew members, David Bowman and Frank Poole, secretly decide to disconnect HAL, but disabling all his higher brain functions, leaving only the most basic functions required to run ship. The death scene of HAL is one of the most poignant deaths in cinema. David Bowman enters HAL's memory bank and begins to shut-down pieces one at a time over the course of 5 minutes. As he does this HAL tells him

> My mind is going.  I can feel it.  I can feel it. I'm afraid.

We've killed a god of our own creation. This is where the movie looses its sense of restraint. All that's left is David Bowman, and the monolith.  There's no body watching to make sure nothing gets out of control. David enters the monolith, and the viewer is treated to a long and disturbing LSD trip: speeding through neon corridors, viscous fog, and green lava.

Watching 2001 in 2017, was the first time this last chapter made as much sense as the early chapters of the film.
A number of my friends who voted for Trump still do not regret their decision to do so, but all of them readily admit that we've entered the monolith.  This is not normal, and that was the point. For them, electing Clinton would be to elect a the self-perpetuating (yet non-living?) capito-polital-intelligence complex that had brought us a Chrony-capitalist America in decline. For them, preventing the election of Clinton was to bring down a god we never intended to create. After the election, every subsequent event had the semblance of meaning obscured by the alienness ... Ah fuck, I'm writing another essay on [SOMETHING] in the age of trump.  I promised myself I wouldn't do this. Fuck it.  I'll try again. Eject. Let's put in a different tape

## Solaris (Tarkovsky)
Solaris is another film in the vain of 2001 Space Oddesey.
... signals from a baby.  Baby trump.  Doesn't have object permanence.

There were two version of this movie, both of which focused less on philosophical questions, and more on the ordeal of encounters with Aliens.  Denis Villeneuve's "The Arrival" is clearly a modern inheritor of the history paved by Tarkovsky and Stanislaw Lem (a much more optimistic movie)

> Science fiction almost always assumed the aliens we meet play some kind of game with us the rules of which we sooner or later may understand (in most cases the "game" was the strategy of warfare).  However I wanted to cut all threads leading to the personification of the Creature, i.e. the Solarian Ocean, so that the contact could not follow the human, interpersonal pattern - although it did take place in some strange manner.  The method I used in the novel to demonstrate this was the particular outcome of the interest of people, who for over one hundred years have been studying the planet "Solaris" and the ocean covering its surface. -Stanislaw lem [link](http://english.lem.pl/arround-lem/adaptations/soderbergh/147-the-solaris-station?showall=&limitstart=)


## Night of the living dead
A movie about fighting large armies of idiots.  We know where this is heading.  Let's do something else.

## Ghost World
In ghost world, we meet Enid.  Somebody who appears to know the truth that most don't learn until their mid thirties.  The ambition


## Conclusion
My mind is going.  I can feel it.  I can feel it.
