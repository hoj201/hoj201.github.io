Teens seem to get all the fun when it comes to new books about a dystopian future society which mirrors our own.  The most notable example is "The hunger games", about a society where children compete against there peers to the death for the entertainment and benefit of a small elite of old white people.  This is clearly a reference to student testing... or something.  It's hard to put you're finger on why these books were so successful, but I think it's because kids intuitively know that the world is strange and getting stranger.  The hunger games series gives children some acknowledgement: yeah, our system is cruel and probably amoral.

While kids can turn to the "Hunger games" to get there fix, there are few adult alternatives which I'm aware of. Malcolm Harris provides at least one in "Kids These Days".

However, unlike the hunger games, you'd find this book in the non-fiction aisle.
