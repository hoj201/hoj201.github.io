## Estimate $$\pi$$
The answer they are looking for is Monte-Carlo.  I think that is not the best answer.
Alternative answers of equal or greater quality exist.  Probably the greeks had a bunch.

## Write a routine to generate uniform random samples on the sphere
What they were looking for was a transformation from spherical coordinates, and then use MCMC or something.
That is not what I would do in practice.
I would just generate a normallly distributed point in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$, and then normalize it.
Proving that this yields a uniform distribution on the sphere was hard to do over the phone to somebody who wasn't accustomed to symmetry arguments (he was smart enough, it's just not a good venue, but)

are you fucking serious.
