<!-- we should destroy mosquitoes -->

<!-- we should also destroy men -->

<!-- we should destroy all humans -->

<!-- no worries, we've already figured it out.  Global warming -->

<!-- fuck. Mosquitoes will flourish -->

<!-- Shit we need to reverse some of this CO2 stuff -->

<!-- We can't seem to cooperate because we are in a game of prisoner's dilemma -->

<!-- Coal/gas are too cheap because it's not paying for externalities.  Also, having it around and not burning it is like leaving a marshmallow on a table and asking a kid not to eat it.  It's just not reasonable. -->

<!-- There seems to be this space race 2.0 thing going on, maybe that could be useful -->

<!-- IDEA: We burn the coal in space and carry the energy home until we exhaust our coal supply.
Wait how do we burn it? There is no air in space.  -->

<!-- QUESTION: Why not just do solar then? -->

<!-- ANSWER: This way we get double impact.  1) same amount of green energy provided 2) and now there is less coal to burn, eventually the cost of coal will rise due to falling supply, and then solar will be super lucrative, and we switch to solar. Also, this puts you on the good side of big oil and gas -->

<!-- we need batteries.  Kinetic energy? -->

<!-- cows, we should grow them, no more methane -->

<!-- still too many ppl eating burgers, and then the ppl start farting.  How do we control the population? -->

<!-- IDEA: We do the same thing we do to the mosquitoes, except it will be to random humans -->

<!-- IDEA: We make a TV show, much like teen mom, but now it's just normal moms, and dads as well -->

<!-- Also, Education??? -->

<!-- Yay, now there is less ppl, less cows, no more burning shit -->

<!-- Meaning? Art? Thinking? -->

<!-- the men will probably be less rapey. Maybe we can spare destroying humans -->

<!-- and we can finally focus on what's important.[something totally not important here] -->
