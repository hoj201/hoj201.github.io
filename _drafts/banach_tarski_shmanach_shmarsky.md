I don't understand what the big deal is is.

## It's so crazy!  How do you fit 2 things into one?
It's easy, cut a tennis ball in half.


## But it's a two things of the same size!
Yeah, but it's not a volume preserving transformation.
I can still cut two tennis balls in half, then just use a honey-I-blew of the kid ray.

## But it's like a crazy transformation!!
Yeah, here's one which is crazier.
The Cantor set is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$
I can embedd $\mathbb{R}$.  However, I can think of an injection from $\mathbb{R}$
 into the the cantor set.

 This transformation is of similar "craziness", and the result is crazier too.
 I mapped a set of infinite measure into a measure-0 subset of itself.

So I ask again.  What's so interesting about the Banack-Tarski paradox.
