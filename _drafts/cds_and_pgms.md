title: PGMs are categories
---

## TLDR
PGMS are categories.  The nodes are priors over various sigma algebras,
the edges are conditional probabilities. Composition is the chain rule of probability.

Cycles are "allowed" but very restricted.
Baye's theorem states that the inverse of arrow is unique (and given by Baye's formula).
